This service is a api gatewy for designing restaurant documents.
It is part of the [restaraunt project](https://github.com/KinNeko-De/restaurant).

# Automation
Every time you push something a [ci pipeline](.github/workflows/ci.yml) will run. As developers, we are working to automate processes and thus eliminate manual work. There's no excuse why we have to do things manually.

# Tests
Write tests whenever they are needed and are useful.

Never try to spare time here. You have to invest more time later.

Never write useless tests to get high code coverage.

Tests need to be maintained as normal code. Keep that in mind while you write tests.
